# TexCalculator
Python has become the defacto language for computational mathematics, and LaTeX is the defacto syntax for writing mathematics research papers.

For complex calculations, Mathematica is often the tool that is used out of neccesity.  But Mathematica is based on a proprietary codebase with it's own custom syntax, and is very expensive for people who are not in academia.

The goal of this project is to create a free, open source calculator that is as powerful as mathematica, but which uses the LaTeX syntax, and is based entirely on open source python math libraries like scipy and sage.

## How to run
for the command line interface:
    python texscript.py

for the web-app
    python server.py
    
## Data-types
The following data types are currently supported
- Integers and real numbers
- Complex numbers
- Vectors and matricies
- Boolean symbols and operators
- Sets

## Examples
See texscript.py for numerous examples, or type show examples from the command line interface.
